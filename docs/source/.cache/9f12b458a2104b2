The -b resource argument is of the form: type=value. The possible type=value\n                        settings are\n                        \u2022 count=N: Execute tests in N batches.

Sets scheme=duration [default: 30 min]\n                        \u2022 scheme=S: Partition tests into batches using the scheme {duration, count, isolate} [default: None]\n                        \u2022 scheduler=S: Submit test batches to scheduler 'S'.\n                        \u2022 workers=N: Execute tests in a batch asynchronously using a pool of at most N workers [default: auto]\n                        \u2022 option=option: Pass *option* to the scheduler.
