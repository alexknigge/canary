fast and long keywords
======================

``nvtest`` supports the ``fast`` and ``long`` :ref:`keywords <directive-keywords>` in a manner similar to `vvtest <https://cee-gitlab.sandia.gov/scidev/vvtest>`_.  If a test is marked ``fast``, its timeout defaults to 2.5 minutes.  If a test is marked ``long``, its timeout defaults to 15 minutes.
