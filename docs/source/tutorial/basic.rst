The remainder of this tutorial uses examples shipped with ``nvtest``.  To obtain a copy of the examples, execute the following command in your shell:

.. code-block:: console

    $ nvtest fetch examples

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    A first test <basic.first>
    A second test <basic.second>
    basic.other
