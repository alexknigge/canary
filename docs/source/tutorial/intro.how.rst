How does nvtest work?
=====================

Given path on your filesystem, ``nvtest``

* searches for **test files**;
* generates **test cases** from those test files;
* asynchronously executes the test cases; and
* reports the results of the execution.

``nvtest`` has many other capabilities designed to streamline the testing process.
